MedEquip Chatbot – Checkpoint Summary (2026-01-01)

What is done
------------
- Core project files created and wired together:
  - config.py: paths, MySQL settings (DB_BACKEND=mysql), OpenAI model config, RAG params.
  - database.py: MySQL-backed schema creation, helper functions, sample data seeding, and
    ensure_mysql_database_exists() so the DB is created automatically.
  - rag_pipeline.py: Chroma + OpenAI embeddings RAG pipeline with 10 core knowledge docs.
  - chatbot.py: MedEquipChatbot class with:
    - Basic rule-based intent classification.
    - Simple SQL generation for orders, tickets, invoices, warranty, spare parts.
    - RAG search integration.
    - CLI loop with commands: quit/exit, auth, history.
  - test_scenarios.py: simple script for UC9 (support hours, no auth) and
    UC1 (order tracking after auth).
  - requirements.txt: Python dependencies for the project.
  - setup_notes.txt: Notes and commands to set up Python env and run the project.
- Environment/secrets:
  - .env file created and populated (OpenAI API key and MySQL connection vars).
- Git:
  - Git repo initialized locally.
  - First commit created on main.
  - Remote origin added and code pushed.
- Utility files:
  - .gitignore configured to ignore venvs, .env, caches, data/vectorstore artifacts, etc.

What to do next session
------------------------
1. Reactivate environment (PowerShell example):

   cd C:\Pani\AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Chatbot
   .venv311\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   (If execution policy blocks scripts, use the temporary bypass from setup_notes.txt.)

2. Ensure dependencies are installed (if using a fresh env):

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Initialize / refresh the database (if needed):

   python database.py

4. Smoke-test chatbot CLI:

   python chatbot.py

   - Ask: "What are your support hours?" (RAG, no auth)
   - Run: auth
     - Email: contact@cityhospital.com
     - Client ID: ME-10001
   - Ask: "When will my order ORD-2024-0001 arrive?" (order/shipments via SQL)

5. Next development steps (after tests pass):
   - Improve intent classification logic and entity extraction.
   - Replace rule-based SQL generator with an LLM-powered SQL generator using
     the prompts from the spec.
   - Replace rule-based response templates with LLM-based response generation.
   - Add more test scenarios and edge-case handling (errors, empty RAG results, etc.).
