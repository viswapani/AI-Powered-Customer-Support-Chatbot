MedEquip Chatbot – Project & Environment Setup Commands (Windows / PowerShell)

1. Project directory

Assuming you’re already in:
pwsh
Initial project layout (executed earlier via tools):
pwsh
2. Python 3.11 virtual environment

Check that Python 3.11 is installed:
pwsh
Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment:
pwsh
Activating the venv in PowerShell

If execution policy allows scripts:
pwsh
If you see the “running scripts is disabled on this system” error, use one of:

Option A – temporary (current session only):
pwsh
Option B – more permanent for your user:

Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
pwsh
Close that window, open a new normal PowerShell, then:
pwsh
Option C – use cmd.exe instead of PowerShell:
cmd
3. Install Python dependencies

With the virtual environment active:
pwsh
(requirements.txt contains: openai, langchain, langchain-openai, langchain-community, chromadb, faker, pandas, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python, pymysql.)

4. MySQL-backed database initialization

Configure MySQL (either via config.py defaults or environment variables):

•  MEDEQUIP_DB_HOST
•  MEDEQUIP_DB_PORT
•  MEDEQUIP_DB_USER
•  MEDEQUIP_DB_PASSWORD
•  MEDEQUIP_DB_NAME

Then run the database initializer (this:

•  auto‑creates the database if needed,
•  creates all tables,
•  seeds sample data):
pwsh
5. Run the chatbot CLI

With the same virtualenv active:
pwsh
Example usage inside the CLI:

•  auth → then enter email / Client ID
•  ask things like:
◦  What are your support hours?
◦  When will my order ORD-2024-0001 arrive?



If you’d like, I can turn this into a more polished README-style setup section tailored to how you plan to deploy (local only vs. Colab vs. server).
