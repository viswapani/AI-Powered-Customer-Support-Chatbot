Summary: “SQL-powered” question templates

Here’s a compact list you can use as a checklist:

1. Order delivery
◦  When will my order ORD-2024-0001 arrive?
◦  What is the delivery status of order ORD-2024-0001?
2. Warranty
◦  What is the warranty status for serial US-2022-1234?
◦  Is my device US-2022-1234 still under warranty?
3. Ticket / issue
◦  What is the status of ticket TKT-2024-0001?
◦  Give me an update on ticket TKT-2024-0001.
4. Invoice / billing
◦  What is the status of invoice INV-2024-3456?
◦  Has invoice INV-2024-3456 been paid?
5. Spare parts
◦  Do you have ECG electrodes in stock?
◦  What spare parts are available for ventilators?

•  One general support:  
  What are your support hours?
•  One policy question:  
  What is your return policy?
•  One compliance question:  
  Does the DL-4000 have FDA 510(k) clearance?
•  One product spec:  
  What are the specifications of the CT-4000 scanner?
•  One AMC/warranty policy:  
  What AMC tiers do you offer and how do they differ?
  
  
  Here’s a short, ordered script you can run (CLI or web UI) to verify everything.

Step 0 – Pre-conditions

•  DB initialized (once): python verify_db.py
•  Qdrant KB initialized (once or via startup): python rag_pipeline.py
•  ENABLE_RAG = True in config.py



Part A – RAG side (no auth required)

1. Support hours (RAG, GENERAL_SUPPORT)  
   What are your support hours?  
   Expect: Text mentioning 24/7 support and phone numbers.

2. Returns policy (RAG)  
   What is your return policy?  
   Expect: 30-day return window, RMA requirement, original packaging.

3. Compliance (RAG)  
   Does the DiagnosticLab DL-4000 have FDA 510(k) clearance?  
   Expect: Answer confirming FDA 510(k) and that it’s for diagnostic imaging.

4. Product specs (RAG)  
   What are the specifications of the CT-4000 scanner?  
   Expect: 128-slice detector, 0.35s rotation, 78cm gantry aperture.

If these give rich, policy/spec-style answers, RAG + Qdrant + OpenAI embeddings are working.



Part B – SQL side (requires auth, uses seeded demo data)

Use exactly these IDs:  
•  Client: contact@cityhospital.com / ME-10001  
•  Order: ORD-2024-0001  
•  Ticket: TKT-2024-0001  
•  Invoice: INV-2024-3456  
•  Serial: US-2022-1234
5. Authenticate (required for all SQL flows)  
◦  In CLI:  
▪  auth  
▪  Email: contact@cityhospital.com  
▪  Client ID: ME-10001  
◦  In web UI: fill in the same and click “Set Authentication”.  
   Expect: message indicating you’re authenticated as City General Hospital / ME-10001.

6. Order delivery (SQL, ORDER_DELIVERY)  
   When will my order ORD-2024-0001 arrive?  
   Expect: Status (e.g., “In Transit”) and expected delivery date.

7. Warranty status (SQL, WARRANTY_AMC)  
   What is the warranty status for serial US-2022-1234?  
   Expect: Warranty ID, start/end dates, coverage level.

8. Ticket status (SQL, ISSUE_RESOLUTION)  
   What is the status of ticket TKT-2024-0001?  
   Expect: Current ticket status and latest history note with timestamp.

9. Invoice status (SQL, FINANCIAL)  
   Has invoice INV-2024-3456 been paid?  
   Expect: Status “Paid” and amount/due date.

10. Spare parts (SQL, SPARE_PARTS)  
    Do you have ECG electrodes in stock?  
    Expect: A line from parts_catalog with stock quantity and unit price.

If A works but B fails → likely DB / auth / MySQL issues.  
If B works but A fails → likely Qdrant / RAG / OpenAI setup.
